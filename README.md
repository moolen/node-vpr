# Minimalistic Point-to-Point VPN

This is a POC implementation of a site-to-site VPN in node. This was implemented for a [nodeHH meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/node-HH/events/251714886/). There's also a POC [implementation in go](https://github.com/moolen/vpr).

WARNING.
Only use this at home. Do not use it in production. Encryption is broken (use aes-gcm or authenticatedi aes-cbc), performance is bad.
